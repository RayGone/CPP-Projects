# Bachelor C++ Projects (2014-2017)
All the files ( .cpp and .txt files) and folder inside the zip folder must be copied to 
bin folder of turbo C++ (i.e tc\bin\ or tc3\bin\ as the folder of turboc++ is named) 
and .cpp file must be compiled before run. 
All the programs are tested only in turboC++.. 

1. cars, maxe, snake and towerOfHanoi are games...
	- > cars is  like f1 race in hand held video games.
	- > maxe is maze game(path finding).
	- > snake is ordinary snake game.
	- > towerOfHanoi is game of solving problem to get disks from 
		starting peg to destination peg using one temporary peg..

2. SudokuSolver, N-queen Problem, id3Algorithm,Tic-Tac-Toe are academic
	- >SudokuSolver solves the given sudoku problem, 
		GUI is implemented, 
		uses constraint propagation and backtracking.
	- > N-queen Problem gives solution to problem of placing- 
		N-queens in N*N size chessboard without any queen checking other, 
		uses bruteforce with backtracking.
	- > id3Algorithm is of ProjectWork for 7th semester, 
		used to predict rainfall, decision tree approach...
	- > tic-tac-toe is game. AI implemented, 
		random-DFS is used for searching, 
			and to make program play the game
